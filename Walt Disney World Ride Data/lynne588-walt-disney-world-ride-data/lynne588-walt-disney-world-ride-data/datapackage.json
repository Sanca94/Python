{"name":"lynne588_walt-disney-world-ride-data","title":"Walt Disney World Ride Data","description":"This shows a variety of characteristics related to the current Walt Disney World ride-specific attractions.\n\nThis data set was originally curated for my masters capstone project where we were designing a new hypothetical new ride for the WDW resort. We wanted to explore the distributions of different characteristics for current rides to determine what isn't being represented/covered. There is a wide variety of characteristics in this data set including location, type, age group interest, ratings, how long the ride has been open, and much more. \n\nData sources that were used to collect the characteristics:\n\nhttps://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/\nhttp://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/ridelength.htm\nhttps://www.wdwmagic.com/attractions/toy-story-land/news/28jun2018-ride-duration-for-slinky-dog-dash-and-alien-swirling-saucers.htm\nhttps://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/attractions/opening-dates\nhttps://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/opening-dates\nhttps://touringplans.com/hollywood-studios/attractions/opening-dates\nhttps://touringplans.com/animal-kingdom/attractions/opening-dates\nhttps://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/disney-vacations/best-worst-disney-world-rides\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g34515-Activities-c56-t278-zfr8428124-Orlando_Florida.html","homepage":"https://data.world/lynne588/walt-disney-world-ride-data","resources":[{"name":"data","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"ride_name","title":"Ride_name","description":"full
